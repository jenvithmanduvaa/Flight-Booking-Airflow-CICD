# Flight Booking Data Engineering Pipeline with Airflow and CICD



## Project Description



This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for processing flight booking data, orchestrated by Apache Airflow and executed using Apache Spark on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with automation managed by GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

The pipeline is designed to perform the following key steps:

### 1. Data Ingestion Trigger: 
The Airflow DAG (airflow_job.py) is configured to wait for the arrival of the flight_booking.csv data file in a specified Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket path.
### 2. Spark Data Transformation: 
Once the input file is detected, Airflow triggers a serverless Spark job on Dataproc. This job, defined in spark_transformation_job.py, reads the flight_booking.csv file from GCS. It then performs several transformations and aggregations, including:
    
    Adding derived columns like is_weekend, lead_time_category, and booking_success_rate.
    Calculating aggregated insights related to flight routes (route_insights) and booking origins (booking_origin_insights).
### 3. Data Loading to BigQuery:    
After transformations, the Spark job writes the processed data and the generated insights into separate tables within Google BigQuery.
### 4. Configuration Management: 
The pipeline uses environment-specific configuration defined in variables/dev/variables.json and variables/prod/variables.json files. These variables, such as GCS bucket names, BigQuery project ID, dataset name, and table names, are managed as Airflow Variables and passed as command-line arguments to the Spark job. This allows the same pipeline code to be deployed and run in different environments with distinct settings.
### 5. CI/CD Automation: 
A GitHub Actions workflow defined in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml automates the deployment process. On pushes to the dev branch, it authenticates to GCP and uploads/imports the necessary files (Airflow variables, Spark job script, Airflow DAG) to the development Airflow Composer environment and GCS. Similarly, on pushes to the main branch, it deploys the code and configuration to the production Airflow Composer environment and GCS. This ensures that code changes are automatically tested and deployed to the respective environments.

In essence, this project provides a robust, automated, and environment-aware pipeline for processing flight booking data from GCS, transforming it with Spark, loading it into BigQuery for analysis, and managing the deployment process via CI/CD.

The pipeline consists of the following components:

Source Data: CSV files containing flight booking information
Cloud Storage: Stores raw input data and PySpark job code
Cloud Composer (Airflow): Orchestrates the pipeline workflow
Dataproc Serverless: Executes PySpark transformation jobs
BigQuery: Stores processed data for analysis
GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD deployment to DEV and PROD environments

The data flow is as follows:

Flight booking CSV data is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
Airflow DAG detects the file and triggers the processing pipeline
Dataproc Serverless executes a PySpark job to transform the data
Transformed data is loaded into BigQuery tables:

Transformed flight data
Route insights
Origin insights


The data is available for analysis and reporting



## Setup and Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.
2.  **Python 3.7+:** Ensure Python is installed.
3.  **Apache Airflow:** A running Airflow environment (local, Docker, or managed service). You'll need to place or configure Airflow to recognize the DAG file (`airflow_job/airflow_job.py`).
4.  **Apache Spark:** A Spark environment (local, cluster, or cloud-based) to execute the Spark job.
5.  **Java:** Spark requires Java to be installed.
6.  **GitHub Account:** To host the repository and use GitHub Actions.
7.  **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** Configured for pushing code and potentially for CI/CD if needed for deployment steps (already addressed during pushing).

## Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jenvithmanduvaa/Flight-Booking-Airflow-CICD.git](https://github.com/jenvithmanduvaa/Flight-Booking-Airflow-CICD.git)
    cd Flight-Booking-Airflow-CICD
    ```

2.  **Switch to the `dev` branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```

3.  **Place project files:** Ensure all necessary project files (like the ones you copied previously) are in this directory. If you followed the previous steps, they should already be here.

4.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the directory containing your `requirements.txt` (if you have one; if not, you'll need to create one listing dependencies like `apache-airflow`, `pyspark`, etc.).
    ```bash
    # Example: If you have a requirements.txt in the root
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or install individually
    # pip install apache-airflow pyspark ...
    ```

5.  **Configure Airflow:**
    Copy the `airflow_job.py` file into your Airflow DAGs folder so Airflow can discover it.
    ```bash
    # Example: Assuming your DAGs folder is ~/airflow/dags
    cp airflow_job/airflow_job.py ~/airflow/dags/
    ```
    Configure any necessary Airflow Connections or Variables as required by `airflow_job.py`.

6.  **Configure Environment Variables/Variables Files:**
    Review the `variables/dev/variables.json` and `variables/prod/variables.json` files. Ensure your Airflow/Spark setup can access the correct environment variables or load configurations from these files as intended by your code.

## Running the Pipeline

1.  **Start Airflow:** Ensure your Airflow scheduler and webserver are running.
2.  **Unpause the DAG:** In the Airflow UI, find the `airflow_job` DAG (or whatever name is defined in the Python file) and unpause it.
3.  **Trigger the DAG:** You can manually trigger the DAG from the Airflow UI or wait for its scheduled run.
4.  **Monitor:** Monitor the DAG run in the Airflow UI to check its progress and view logs if steps fail.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml` file defines the automated workflow that runs on GitHub Actions. Typically, this workflow will:

* Checkout the code.
* Set up Python.
* Install dependencies.
* Perform code quality checks (linting, formatting).
* Run tests (if you have them).
* (Potentially) Check DAG syntax.
* (Potentially) Build and push Docker images.
* (Potentially) Deploy to your target environment.

Check the `ci-cd.yaml` file for the specific steps implemented in your CI/CD pipeline. Monitor the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository for the status of workflow runs triggered by your commits.

## Configuration

Configuration settings are managed in the `variables/` directory, separated by environment (`dev`, `prod`). Your Airflow and Spark jobs should be written to load configurations from the appropriate `variables.json` file based on the execution environment.
